# Day 4: Nmap and Network Scanning

In today's session, we delved deep into network scanning using Nmap. We covered a variety of topics, explored essential commands, and even performed a practical example on `keralauniversity.ac.in`.

## Topics Covered--

### 1. **Nmap**

**Nmap** (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery and security auditing. It helps in discovering hosts and services on a computer network.

### 2. **Recon**

Reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target network or system. This is the first step in ethical hacking.

### 3. **OSINT**

**Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)** involves collecting data from publicly available sources to gather information on a target.

### 4. **IDS and IPS**

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System):** Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System):** Monitors and takes action to prevent detected threats.

### 5. **Why Not to Ping**

Pinging a website can sometimes alert IDS/IPS systems, leading to blocking or tracking of your IP address. Using more subtle methods can avoid detection.

### Practical Example

We used Nmap to scan `keralauniversity.ac.in` with the following command:

```sh
sudo nmap -Pn -p21,22,53,80,81,433,800,8080 -sV -oN test.txt keralauniversity.ac.in

## Detailed Analysis
### Accessing Vulnerable Websites
You can use websites like ```testphp.vulnweb.com```to perform various attacks for learning purposes.

### Key Concepts Explained


### 1. *Recon*
Definition: Gathering preliminary data on a target.
Example: Using Nmap to identify open ports.

### 2. *OSINT*:
Definition: Collecting publicly available information.
Example: Using Google to find information on a target.

### 3. *IDS and IPS*:
IDS Example: Snort.
IPS Example: Cisco Firepower.

### 4. *Why Not to Ping*:
Reason: Alerts IDS/IPS systems.

View headers sent by the server.


### 6. *Wafw00f*:
Used to identify the Firewall service used by the website

from this ğŸ‘‡ also you can find the information about the website which we gather from the 

``` Inspect -> Network -> Status -> Version -> Request Header -> Response Header ```
